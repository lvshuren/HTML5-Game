Rules:

- You have two dices, except total numbers(2~12) we care nothing.
- If sum is (7 or 11), you win.
- If sum is (2,3 or 12), you are failed.
- If sum is (4,5,6,8,9,10), record the count(n), then throw again, if the next sum is n, you win, if the next sum is 7, you are failed. the other results, throw again...
